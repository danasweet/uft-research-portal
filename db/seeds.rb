results = ["Overall, beavers showed a preference for certain species of trees, and their preference was based on distance from the central place. Measurements taken at the study site show that beavers avoided oaks and musclewood (Fig. 1) and show a significant food preference (x2=447.26, d.f.=9, P<.05). No avoidance or particular preference was observed for the other tree species. The mean distance of 8.42 m away from the water for not-chewed trees was significantly greater than the mean distance of 6.13 m for chewed trees (t=3.49, d.f.=268, P<.05) (Fig. 2). The tree species that were avoided were not significantly farther from the water (t=.4277, d.f.=268, P>.05) than selected trees. For the selected tree species, no significant difference in circumference was found between trees that were not chewed (mean=16.03 cm) and chewed (mean=12.80 cm) (t=1.52, d.f.=268, P>.05)", "No significant differences were found in males' time to mount among the three treatments or among the three control trials based on a repeated measures ANOVA (Table 1). Males mounted black painted females as readily as females with the typical black and orange pattern. There was a slight, but not significant, increase in male's mean time to mount for the black treatment as compared to the normal and clear treatments (Figure 1). The 95% confidence intervals were also larger for the black treatment. The first control trial had a slightly larger, but not significantly different, male's mean time to mount as compared to the second and third trials (Figure 2). The male's mean times to mount were lower for the three control trials than for the three experimental treatments.", "After compiling all the results into two tables, one may see that there is a large difference in the abundance of species, or species richness, between Cadron Creek and Tucker Creek aquatic communities. There were 16 different species of fish discovered in Cadron Creek, and only 7 found in Tucker Creek (Table 1, Table 2). The species proportions, or species evenness, were also very different. There was a much higher proportion of the dominant species in Tucker Creek compared to the dominant species proportions found in Cadron Creek. The ShannonWeiner Index of Cadron Creek fell within the normal range (1.5-3.5) at 2.434, whereas the Shannon-Weiner Index of Tucker Creek was slightly lower than the normal range at 1.4. The higher Shannon-Weiner Index value shows a higher species evenness and species richness in Cadron Creek’s community structure"]

observations = ["Paramecia are smaller than Amoebas.", "They move with the help of microscopic hair-like structures called cilia which act like oars to push them through the water.", "They swim by rotating slowly and changing directions often.", "If the Paramecium comes upon an obstacle it stops swims backwards, and then angles itself forward on a slightly different course.", "Cilia help the Paramecium move as well as feed. When the Paramecia feed it does so by drawing its food into a funnel-shaped opening called the oral groove that is lined with cilia (see Fig. 2).", "The oral groove is like a mouth taking food in with the help of cilia which direct and move the food inward.", "The Euglena moves rapidly using its flagellum to propel itself through the water rather quickly shifting directions with whip-like movements.", "Unlike the Amoeba and the Paramecium the Euglena has plant-like characteristics.", "It is sometimes referred to as a “plant-like” protist.", "The organelle that gives it this plant-like quality is the chloroplast (see Fig. 1) a green organelle responsible for carrying out photosynthesis in plants.", "The Euglena senses light with a light-sensitive organelle called the “eyespot,” which directs the organism to a light source strong enough for photosynthesis to occur.", "Since it can undergo photosynthesis Euglena is able to make its own food just like plants.", "One difficulty in resolving the data in the vibration-rotation spectroscopy experiment is determining the quantum numbers associated with each transition.", "For diatomic molecules the J=0 ↔ J=0 transition is forbidden and will be absent from the spectrum.", "This makes the separation of the first transition of the R branch from the first transition of the P branch approximately twice the spacing of the other transitions (which are otherwise roughly equally spaced).", "Examination of the difference between the line positions (second column of Table I) reveals that the lines are not exactly equally spaced.", "In particular, the two transitions at 2139.427 cm-1 and 2147.084 cm-1 have a much wider separation than the others.", "It is reasonable to assign these two transitions to J=1→J’=0 and J=0→J’=1, one from the P branch and one from the R branch.", "The laboratory was a collaborated effort with four levels of stress performed including 0.9σy 0.8σy 0.7σy and 0.6σy.", "Once all the data was collected an analysis of the different stress levels when compared to the number of cycles until failure was completed.", "The analysis process began by finding the average of cycles until failure at each level of stress.", "The standard deviation was then taken as well.", "Table 1 shows the number of cycles until failure received in the lab as well as the averages standard deviation and loaded weight of each stress level."]

conclusions = ["In our first investigation we measured gravity as 971.64 ± 153.36 c /s^2, which is equal the given value of 9.81m/s^2. But in our second investigation our gravity of 601.37 ± 153.36 cm/s^2 is not equal to 9.81 m/s^2. Extra forces that we didn’t account for, or rotational effects, could have decreased the acceleration of the pucks. Newton’s second law tells us no matter the amount of weight our gravity should still equal 9.81m/s^2, but that was not the case in our second investigation. A different method of tying and Velcroing the two pucks together might alleviate the rotational effects if the experiment was performed over again.", "In this lab I learned about the structure and function of the smallest eukaryotic organisms, the unicellular protists. Although very tiny, these organisms are very complex, housing all the necessary life tools in one single cell. This shows that the complexity of an organism is not necessarily related to its size. I also learned to identify and classify different types of protists. I was able to observe locomotion patterns as well as other characteristic features. In doing so, I gained useful microscopy skills such as making wet mount slides, finding the proper magnification for viewing, and drawing microscope observations with all the proper labels.", "In this lab I learned about the structure and function of the smallest eukaryotic organisms, the unicellular protists.

As the null hypothesis (that males' time to mount is not significantly affected by color of the female) was not rejected, males evidently used those other traits in seeking a mate. The male behavior of mounting other adults (male or female) and not nymphs may indicate that there are pheromonal differences between nymphs and adults but not between adult males and females. Males release other males rapidly once contact has been made, so chemical cues transferred by touch or other close range signals (such as sound) may be used to distinguish males from females. There are slight shape differences between nymphs and adults (nymphs are more spherical) that could possibly be used by males in mating decisions. Other experiments are necessary to determine the nature of the communication between adults and between adults and nymphs.", "As mentioned earlier, this experiment has led to many other researchable questions. Further testing should be done in order to determine the effects of competition upon the average biomass of root systems of Trifolium repens and Brassicus napas to determine if the Trifolium repens undergrowth was also suppressed by the rapid growing Brassicus napas. The hypothesis for this experiment would state that the rapid growing Brassicus napas would outcompete Trifolium repens and that the root system of Trifolium repens would be much smaller in the presence of another species. A second experiment may be performed to determine the limiting factor of Trifolium repens, whether it is nutrients or space availability. The hypothesis for this experiment would state that space and nutrients were both limiting factors in the growth of Trifolium repens. This would explain how Brassicus napas so successfully outcompeted Trifolium repens in the current experiment. Even though many of the results did not support the hypotheses, one may conclude that intraspecific and interspecific competition did occur in each experiment."]

procedures = ["We conducted a chi-squared test to analyze the data with respect to beaver selection of certain tree species. We conducted t-tests to determine (1) if avoided trees were significantly farther from the water than selected trees, and (2) if chewed trees were significantly larger or smaller than not chewed trees. Mean tree distance from the water and mean tree circumference were also recorded.", "Number each battery so you can tell them apart. Measure each battery's voltage by using the voltmeter. Put the same battery into one of the devices and turn it on. Let the device run for thirty minutes before measuring its voltage again. (Record the voltage in a table every time it is measured.) Repeat step 4 until the battery is at 0.9 volts or until the device stops. Do steps 1–5 again, three trials for each brand of battery in each experimental group. For the camera flash push the flash button every 30 seconds and measure the voltage every 5 minutes. For the flashlights rotate each battery brand so each one has a turn in each flashlight. For the CD player repeat the same song at the same volume throughout the tests.", "In this experiment, air (an ideal gas) was heated in a pressure vessel with a volume of 1 liter. Attached to this pressure vessel was a pressure transducer and thermocouple to measure the pressure and the temperature, respectively, of the air inside the vessel. Both of these transducers produced voltage signals (in Volts) that were calibrated to the pressure (kPa) and temperature (K) of the air (the atmospheric pressure for where the experiment occurred is assumed to be 13.6 psia). In addition, the theoretical temperature (K) of air was calculated as a function of the measured pressured values (kPa).", "As described in the lab manual,[3] ice was placed in a beaker and warmed until approximately 50% had melted.  The temperature of the ice/water mixture was then measured with a thermometer. This was followed by a similar measurement of our solid unknown.  In part II, water was heated until boiling and the temperature of the liquid/gas mixture measured with a thermometer.  This was followed by a similar measurement using our unknown compound.  To get the best results possible, the procedure in the manual was modified by repeating each trial three times.", "Record the barometric pressure.  Measure about 10 g of ice using the chemical balance and place it into a 100 mL beaker.  Heat over a flame until half of the ice has melted.  Remove from heat and measure the temperature as accurately as possible using your laboritory thermometer.   Repeat with a 10.0 g sample of your unknown.  Be sure to record your unknown number.  Measure 50 mL of  water using your graduated cylindar and pour it into a 200 mL beaker.  Bring the liquid to a boil over a flame.  After the liquid has been boiling for approximately 1-2 minutes, measure the temperature of the boiling liquid.   Repeat with a 10 g sample of your unknown.  Record all data in your lab notebook and clean up.", "The 1000 milliliter flask fitted with a three hole rubber stopper, separatory funnel and a measuring pipet.  First, fill Erlenmeyer flask with 250 milliliters of distilled water.  Put the glass tube with a right angle bend into one hole of the three hole stopper.  Place stopper in flask making sure no air bubbles are trapped. Take a plant shoot and cut in the sink under running water.  Remove the shoot from water and place the stem through the hole in the stopper and allow one inch of the stem to go into the water in the flask.  Place a separate funnel in third hole and fill with water to the upper mark.  Coat all joints will sealant and record the position of the meniscus at two minute intervals for 30 minutes. Move the apparatus to the fume hood and measure every two minutes for 30 minutes. Place a plastic bag over the leafy part of the shoot and fasten with a rubber band.  Measure this for an additional ten minutes.", "In preparing the catecholase extract, a potato was skinned, washed, and diced. 30.0 g of the diced potato and 150 ml of distilled water were added to a kitchen blender and blended for approximately two minutes. The resulting solution was filtered through four layers of cheese cloth. The extract was stored in a clean, capped container. Four individually labeled spectrophotometer tubes were prepared using different amounts (as represented in Table 1) of the following reagents: a buffer of pH 7, a 0.1% catechol substrate, and distilled water. The wavelength of the Spectronic 20 spectrophotometer was set at 540 nm. To calibrate the specrophotometer at zero absorbance, a blank control tube prepared with no catechol substrate and labeled tube 1 was inverted and inserted into the spectrophotometer. It is important to note that the extract to be tested was added to each tube immediately before placing the tube into the spectrophotometer. 1.0 ml of catecholase extract was pipetted into tube 2. Tube 2 was immediately inverted and placed in the spectrophotometer. The absorbance was read and recorded for time zero (t0), the ten minute mark (t10), and each minute in between. Tube 2 was removed from the spectrophotometer and the same measurements were taken for tube 3 and tube 4 using the same protocol.", "Three protists were chosen for observation. See the list of protists below to choose three samples. For each of the protists, a pipette was used to extract a few drops of culture from the culture jar. The drops of culture were placed on a clean microscope slide and covered with a slide cover slip. Using a light microscope, each protist was examined at different magnifications until the best field of view was found for identifying cellular structures. The color, shape, and motion cellular structures was noted. Each of the protists was drawn and the drawings were labeled. Field-of-view, magnification, and cell size was noted on the drawings, along with the organism’s name and protist group.", "This experiment was designed to show the effects of competition upon the survival and growth of Brassicus napas and Trifolium repens in a five week time period. Both plants are known to have moderate-rapid growth, and are easy to identify. They are relatively common and frequently used in experimentation due to inexpensive cost. To study the influence of intraspecific competition, six seeds of Brassicus napas were potted in each of the seven labeled plastic plant pots and six seeds of Trifolium repens were potted in each of the next seven labeled plastic plant pots. To study the influence of interspecific competition, four seeds per plant pot of each species were planted in seven more labeled plastic plant pots. Each pot contained un-fertilized soil. The potting steps were repeated. The second group of plant pots (containing 7 Brassicus napas, 7 Trifolium repens, and 7 mixed) were placed in an area where they would receive fertilizer treatments at regular intervals. After two weeks, each pot was thinned in order to regulate the number of plants per pot, and to regulate that each species had an equal number of individual organisms in the mixed pot. This would ensure the most precise results. After five weeks, the average numbers of individuals present in each pot was recorded and a t-test was run to determine the accuracy of the hypotheses."]
